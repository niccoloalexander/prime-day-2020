# prime-day-2020

### The App
This app was built by Niccolo Alexander Hamlin to explore how Amazon Prime Day affects customer sales and advertisting as detailed in the prompt below. 
It was built using Plotly Dash, Dash Bootstrap Components, Pandas, and SQLite. All figures are generated with mock data. Find the deployed app [here](https://prime-day-2020-dash.herokuapp.com/prime-day-2020-statistics/market). 

### The Prompt
"*Amazon Prime Day is an annual deal event exclusively for Prime members, delivering two days of epic deals on products on all kind of businesses and brands."*

* What was the impact of Prime Day on Sales? 
* Was advertising efficient during the event? 
* What type of advertising worked best?
